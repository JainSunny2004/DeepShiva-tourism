      "explanation": "India generates massive plastic waste, much ending up in rivers, oceans, and mountains. Pilgrimage and tourist sites struggle with plastic pollution. Reusable bottles with filters allow safe drinking water refills from taps, reducing plastic waste significantly. Many temples and tourist spots now have water refill stations.",

Your stay directly supports local families and preserves traditional lifestyles. Look for certifications or practices like composting, renewable energy, plastic-free policies, and local sourcing.",

      "explanation": "High-altitude ecosystems are fragile and decomposition is extremely slow due to cold. Orange peels take 2 years to decompose, plastic centuries. Carry garbage bags and bring all waste down. Many treks now require waste deposit as part of permit. Even biodegradable items should be carried out. Human waste should be properly disposed at designated spots only.",

Tourist water consumption often competes with local community needs.",

      "explanation": "Mass-produced 'ethnic' souvenirs often come from factories, giving nothing to local communities. Buying directly from artisans ensures fair payment and encourages craft preservation. Traditional skills like weaving, pottery, metalwork are dying as artisans lack income. Visit artisan villages, cooperatives, or certified shops. Ask about the making process - genuine artisans are proud to explain.",

      "explanation": "Local, seasonal food has minimal transportation carbon footprint. Supporting local eateries keeps money in community and preserves culinary traditions. Large chains import ingredients and franchise profits leave the area. Regional cuisine is fresher, more authentic, and often healthier. Seasonal eating is also more sustainable as it doesn't require greenhouse cultivation or long-distance transport.",

      "explanation": "Major temples see thousands of daily visitors, generating tons of plastic waste from prasad bags, plates, and disposable items. Sacred rivers are choked with plastic offerings. Carry cloth bags for prasad and food. Choose reusable plates if eating at temple langars. Many temples now encourage or provide eco-friendly options. Respect sacred spaces by not polluting them.",

      "explanation": "Photographing people without consent is disrespectful and can be exploitative, especially of tribal communities and vulnerable groups. Drones disturb wildlife, violate privacy, and are banned in many protected and border areas. Some temples prohibit photography of deities. Responsible photography means consent, cultural sensitivity, and following regulations. The best memories don't always need to be photographed.",

      "explanation": "Many remote locations depend on diesel generators for electricity, which is expensive and polluting. Even in grid-connected areas, India faces power demands. Tourist accommodations consume disproportionate energy. Switching off unused devices, using natural light, and moderating AC use significantly reduces environmental impact. Some eco-lodges run entirely on solar power - respect their limited capacity.",

Renting from local shops in trekking hubs supports local economy and reduces waste. Rental gear is well-maintained and appropriate for local conditions. If buying is necessary, choose durable, quality items you'll use repeatedly, or sell/donate after your trip.",

      "explanation": "Sustainable tourism includes cultural sustainability. Respectful behavior ensures communities remain welcoming to tourists. Immodest dress at temples offends devotees. Learning basic phrases shows respect. Understanding customs prevents offense. When local culture is respected, tourism benefits communities rather than disrupting them. Cultural erosion from insensitive tourism damages destinations as much as environmental degradation.",

      "explanation": "Over-tourism during peak seasons strains infrastructure, damages sites, inflates prices, and degrades experience. Off-season travel reduces crowding, allows genuine interactions with locals who have more time, and spreads tourism income across the year. Destinations are more accessible, accommodation cheaper, and environment less stressed. Many places are beautiful in off-season too.",
